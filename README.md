YouTube tutorial from Tech with Tim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I

This code runs from the command line (CLI) by initiating main.py (python main.py)

Just follow the prompts

## Challenges

As it stands, the app does not like non-integer bets.

Betting more lines than your balance asks you to change your bet, not your lines. At that point, the only way out is CTL C. -- UPDATE - the app now informs you if you choose more lines than your balance. There is still an issue with the recursion in that it doesn't seem to register the new choice the first time, but it will the second.

## Enhancements

I added several features, including clearer descriptions of the betting options i.e. number of lines, balance available, and max bet per line.

I also added a spin counter, so that the user can see how many spins it took to lose the initial deposit.

## ToDo

Create front-end
