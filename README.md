## Challenges

As it stands, the app does not like non-integer bets, though it does suggest them.

## Enhancements

I added several features, including clearer descriptions of the betting options i.e. number of lines, balance available, and max bet per line.

I also added a spin counter, so that the user can see how many spins it took to lose the initial deposit.

## ToDo

Create front-end
